This repository contains replication materials for the paper "In Validations We Trust? The Impact of Imperfect Human Annotations as a Gold Standard on the Quality of Validation of Automated Content Analysis," forthcoming in Political Communication. For any questions or inquries, please contact the corresponding author (Hyunjin Song, hyunjin.song@univie.ac.at).

This replication code is dependent upon rstan library for simulation analysis. For installing rstan and Stan library, see [Rstan start guide](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html).

# Structure of the Repository

Replication codes for reproducing the results reported in the paper are located within ```r``` directory, where the order of the code excution is marked with number preceeding each r codes. Data for reproducing Table 1 are located in ```Dat``` directory, and simulation results (as Rdata file) are saved in ```Results``` directory.

```0.coding materials.R``` - details on reliability assessment on manual codings of extant studies.

```1.Lit review.R``` - replication codes for Table 1.

```2.MC simulation.R``` - main simulation analysis. This script also produces all of the figures reported in the ms.
